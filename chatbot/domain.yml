  - text: "The king wanted to test the advisor’s brilliance and came up with a question “how many birds are there in our kingdom?”

           The advisor answered immediately that there are twenty-eight thousand birds in the kingdom.

           The king was surprised by his answer and asked, “What if there are more birds?” The advisor replied that maybe a few birds from other kingdoms visit our kingdom.

           When asked what if there are a lesser number of birds, the advisor replied birds from our kingdom are visiting other kingdoms too.

           The king enjoyed the clever answers of his advisor.

           Moral of this short story:

           You will find a solution to every question if you think in a simple way."

           Raju cultivated cotton crops and believed in his hard work to look after their growth. After 6 to 8 months, the cotton crops were fully grown. There was more demand for cotton during that time.

           A cotton textile manager bought all the cotton from Raju and paid a huge amount to him. This way Raju earned profit and was successful in supporting his family.

           The fox refused and went closer to the squirrel. The squirrel requested that it was his only son’s birthday and he met with an accident while bringing food. The fox was not so cunning and let the squirrel go.
           After a few months, the squirrel saw a bear getting closer to the fox while the fox was asleep. The squirrel immediately ran to the fox and helped him escape from the bear. The fox was saved by the squirrel and they became good friends.

           One of the birds escaped from the trap and searched for his parents. The Bird finally reached a hermitage where it was invited and had some food. He lived happily.

           A traveler once came across the other bird that was captured by the villager. He spoke very rudely to him. He was surprised to see a talking bird but was also upset with his behavior.

           The traveler visited the hermitage and recognized the similar talking bird but this bird spoke politely and invited him to stay there.

           One day, the boy stole a few toffees when the shopkeeper was not looking.

           The shopkeeper while closing the shop remembered that he did not see the mischievous boy that today.

           The boy felt good as he took the toffees without telling the shopkeeper. He ate the toffees and went to sleep.

           The next day he wanted to go to the shop just like he visited every day but he was scared that the shopkeeper would find out. He felt guilty and confessed his mistake.

           The landlord was crooked and cunning. He added more interest to the money and manipulated the illiterate farmers. He occupied the lands of all the farmers even though they paid the amount borrowed.

           One day, a schoolgirl found a book of money calculations near the landlord’s house. She found many mistakes in the calculations. She went to the sarpanch and explained the problem. The landlord was punished and everyone received their own lands.
